Working with Form & it's items:
===========================
1.form:
-----------
	->It is a container to design rest of items
	->Through form only we can send all items to a desired location(address->action)

syntax:
	<form   name=""   action=""  method="Get/Post">


	</form>

1.name	=>  Name of form
2.action	=> Here we have to specify address(URL) that accepts our form data
	Ex:
		www.amazon.in/reg

3.method=> Type of request i.e get/post


get vs post:
=========
		Get			Post

1.Get request data is visible in URL		1.Post request data is encrypted  in URL	

2.Get request is very fast			2.Post request is very slow

3.Get request is not secured			3.Post request is highly secured	

4.Get request send limited data to server	4.Post request send unlimited data to server

5.Get is default method			5.Post is not default method & it should be configured

	<form>				<form	method="post">

	</form>				</form>

6.Reading data from server			6.Sending data to server
		
7.Get is best for searching data		7.Post is best for securing data
